This folder contains phylogenies for the comparative analysis of trait values
(domestication, woodiness, mycorrhiza) and niche dimensions. We currently have the
following trees:

- [Tree.nex.bt.nex](Tree.nex.bt.nex) is the phylogeny used in 
  [Feijen et al.](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-28920-x). For this tree, the 
  pattern of mycorrhizal association on all tips is known.
