This directory is a placeholder for files with occurrence data.

We are **not** going to store large sets of occurrence data for our use cases here,
they go in a [separate repository](https://github.com/rvosa/sdmdl-angiosperm-data).

We are **not** going to redistribute this directory structure with the published 
package, as we [exclude](https://github.com/naturalis/sdmdl/blob/e7d347a9b0ace43856770ee2dd7a48677194497a/setup.py#L18)
it from the package.

We have 
[marked](https://github.com/naturalis/sdmdl/blob/04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8/README.md#L33)
this folder structure for **deletion**, hence, it is likely to disappear soon.
