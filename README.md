# trait-geo-diverse-angiosperms
This repository is built for the development a deep learning species distribution modelling (DL-SDM) package using the python and R programming languages. The DL-SDM package will allow for a more intuitive and easy exploration of biodiversity patterns by modelling preferences for a great number of environmental variables. 
This repository contains three different sub-projects. These are used as case studies to evaluate the performance of the DL-SDM package:

* Domesticated crops and their wild progenitors
* Mycorhizzal associations
* Secondary woodiness

The files included in the repository are organized as follows:

* scripts - scripts and final DL-SDM package.
* data - all data, including occurrences & GIS layers
* results - output of the models
* docs - documentation files

This project builds on the previous results obtained by:

- [MAXENT modelling](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-geo-diverse-ungulates) by Elke Hendrix.
- [Deep learning](https://github.com/naturalis/trait-geo-diverse-dl) by Mark Rademaker.
