Species lists
-------------

We have three sets of species to reconcile:

1. [Crops](crops.md)
2. [Plants with/without derived woodiness](woody.md)
3. [Plants with known mycorrhizal association](mycorrhiza.md)

Occurrence data
---------------

Based on the reconciled species list, we collect occurrence data from [GBIF](http://gbif.org)
and store these as TSV tables in the [../data](../data) folder.
