Some simple guidelines:
- We use UNIX line breaks (\n) always
- We follow the PEP recommendations as indicated by the IDE
- Any additional imports are added to requirements.txt
- You break it, you bought it: fix broken builds
- Test coverage should get to Â±80%
- Keep cruft (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.) out of the repo
